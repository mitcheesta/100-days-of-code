#100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0 - 2020.08.22
**Today's Progress**: Spent some time on setting up a local Laravel environment for practice. Reviewed PHP types and functions afterwards.

**Thoughts**: Got Homestead on VirtualBox working, but after further research, I decided to switch over to Laragon for improved speed and better functionality. Encountered an issue with dynamically converting a project over to Nginx from Apache, but after some tinkering with config files, I found that recreating the project was the cleanest way to fix the issue.

### Day 1 - 2020.08.23
**Today's Progress**: Continued to review PHP types and functions. Began acquainting myself with basic Laravel MVC features and routing functionality.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying the framework so far and commands have felt very intuitive. 

### Day 2 - 2020.08.24
**Today's Progress**: Worked with MySQL DB using Laravel. Familiarized myself with Eloquent Models, migration functionality, and tinker mode.

**Thoughts**: Continuing to enjoy working with this framework. I can see why some people have concerns that it obscures a lot of functionality from newer programmers who haven't had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with those concepts. Luckily I don't have that concern for myself.

### Day 3 - 2020.08.27
**Today's Progress**: Helping out a friend with some basic CSS changes

**Thoughts**: I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable I still am with CSS.Wordpress.org is a bit annoying and unintuitive to work with. Working with the HTML directly is much more effective than hoping that the block editor does what you want it to.

### Day 4 - 2020.08.28
**Today's Progress**: Helping out friend translate some wireframing into CSS. Refreshed my knowledge of Flex Grid and CSS Grids

**Thoughts**: Wordpress.org, especially with a non-Business account, is ridiculously restrictive. Thankfully CSS has become powerful enough to make interactive websites without being able to customize JavaScript.

### Day 5 - 2020.08.29
**Today's Progress**: Helping out friend make site responsive for 3 breakpoints: monitor, tablet, and mobile.

**Thoughts**: Most of the site was already set due to the good foundation that the existing CSS created. Had to wrangle with the default theme's quirks, but I think the result was respectable.
