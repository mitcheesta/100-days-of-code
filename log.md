#100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 0 - 2020.08.22
**Today's Progress**: Spent some time on setting up a local Laravel environment for practice. Reviewed PHP types and functions afterwards.

**Thoughts**: Got Homestead on VirtualBox working, but after further research, I decided to switch over to Laragon for improved speed and better functionality. Encountered an issue with dynamically converting a project over to Nginx from Apache, but after some tinkering with config files, I found that recreating the project was the cleanest way to fix the issue.

### Day 1 - 2020.08.23
**Today's Progress**: Continued to review PHP types and functions. Began acquainting myself with basic Laravel MVC features and routing functionality.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying the framework so far and commands have felt very intuitive. 

### Day 2 - 2020.08.24
**Today's Progress**: Worked with MySQL DB using Laravel. Familiarized myself with Eloquent Models, migration functionality, and tinker mode.

**Thoughts**: Continuing to enjoy working with this framework. I can see why some people have concerns that it obscures a lot of functionality from newer programmers who haven't had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with those concepts. Luckily I don't have that concern for myself.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
